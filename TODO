 * DictionaryManager manager parses /usr/share/locale/locale.alias,
   which doesn't sound like a good idea and would likely be better if
   it would just be a buildin list, also there is /etc/locale.alias
   which isn't handled at all.

 * tinygettext has gained a lot of external dependecies in SuperTux:
   SDL, physfs, log.h, config.h, ... these have to be trimmed down or
   #ifdef'ed with HAVE_LIBSDL, HAVE_PHYSFS

 * comments should be parsed, since they contain meta information such
   as fuzzy markers

 * a hashmap instead of std::map might be a good idea

 * support for .gmo files would be cool

 * a recomment procedure do handle words with multiple meanings should
   be documented:

   Exit -> Ausgang
   Exit -> Beenden

# EOF #
