 * tinygettext has gained a lot of external dependecies in SuperTux:
   SDL, physfs, log.h, config.h, ... these have to be trimmed down or
   #ifdef'ed with HAVE_LIBSDL, HAVE_PHYSFS

 * comments should be parsed, since they contain meta information such
   as fuzzy markers

 * a hashmap instead of std::map might be a good idea

 * support for .gmo files would be cool
